# WhisperCache
WhisperCache is a whisper caching solution that will allow you to never miss a whisper again. Each time a player whispers you,
the message is saved across all characters until you reply to the person or manually view your missed whispers.

Simply type /wc in game to view your missed whispers at any given time.

## Download
You can download WhisperCache on the Minion/Twitch app or through any of the following locations:

Curse: [https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/whispercache](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/whispercache)\
WoW Interface: [http://wowinterface.com/downloads/info23775-WhisperCache.html](http://wowinterface.com/downloads/info23775-WhisperCache.html)

A bleeding edge version of WhisperCache can also be used by visiting its GitHub repository here: [https://github.com/snailsoftware/whispercache](https://github.com/snailsoftware/whispercache) (The files here can change many times a day so it's not recommended to use this version of WhisperCache unless you know what you are doing)
