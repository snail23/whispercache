# WhisperCache
WhisperCache is a whisper caching solution that will allow you to never miss a whisper again. Each time a player whispers you,
the message is saved across all characters until you reply to the person or manually view your missed whispers.

Simply type /wc in game to view your missed whispers at any given time.
